# k0rdent Catalog

{{{ docsVersionInfo.k0rdentName }}} is composable by design. The open source community around k0rdent has created a host of composable components that can be leveraged by {{{ docsVersionInfo.k0rdentName }}} users -- available through the [k0rdent Catalog](https://catalog.k0rdent.io). Mirantis and partners jointly support a subset of these components for key use-cases.

Several of these Solutions are documented in this section. These include:

* [**Ceph Unified Storage**](addons/ceph/index.md) is an open‚Äêsource, distributed storage platform that offers unified block, file, and object storage. When run under Kubernetes, it provides scalable, resilient, and self-healing data management using commodity hardware.
