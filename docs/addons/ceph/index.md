**Ceph cluster configuration official docs**

> **Note:** This guide will be supported by Mirantis official documentation later this year (2025), so this section may be skipped in upcoming releases.

Official documentation for Ceph cluster configuration is available at:  
[https://docs.mirantis.com/mosk/latest/ops/ceph-operations.html](https://docs.mirantis.com/mosk/latest/ops/ceph-operations.html)  
While this guide covers MOSK KaasCephCluster, it is still applicable for configuring a MiraCeph cluster. To apply the same documentation to a Ceph cluster, the operator should use the MiraCeph resource instead of the KaasCephCluster resource.
