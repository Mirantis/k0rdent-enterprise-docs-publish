# Install {{{ docsVersionInfo.k0rdentName }}}

This section assumes that you already have a kubernetes cluster installed. If you need to setup a cluster you can follow the [Create and prepare a Kubernetes cluster with k0s](./create-mgmt-clusters/mgmt-create-k0s-single.md) to create a test cluster, or [Create and prepare a production grade Kubernetes cluster with EKS](./create-mgmt-clusters/mgmt-create-eks-multi.md) to create something more substantial. 

The actual management cluster is a Kubernetes cluster with the {{{ docsVersionInfo.k0rdentName }}} application installed. The simplest way to install {{{ docsVersionInfo.k0rdentName }}} is through its Helm chart.  You can find the latest release [here](https://github.com/k0rdent/kcm/tags), and from there you can deploy the Helm chart, as in:

> NOTE:
> Don't forget to [verify the installation files](sbom.md).


```shell
helm install kcm {{{ extra.docsVersionInfo.ociRegistry }}} --version {{{ extra.docsVersionInfo.k0rdentDotVersion }}} -n kcm-system --create-namespace
```
```console
Pulled: ghcr.io/k0rdent/kcm/charts/kcm:{{{ extra.docsVersionInfo.k0rdentDotVersion }}}

The helm chart deploys the KCM operator and prepares the environment, and KCM then proceeds to deploy the various subcomponents, including CAPI. The entire process takes a few minutes.

## Cleanup: Uninstall {{{ docsVersionInfo.k0rdentName }}}

And of course when you need to clean up, you can use helm as well:

```shell
helm uninstall kcm -n kcm-system
```
